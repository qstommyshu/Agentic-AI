    "\n",
    "Whether you fully appreciate it or not, both of the systems demonstrated in notebook 1a were, in fact, **agent systems**. They were software systems where at least one software component semantically percieved the environment and responded to the best of their ability to satisfy a vague objective.\n",
    "- The basic chat loop was literally just a loop that sampled responses from the LLM and the user in a loop. The environment is the message bus, the agents are you and the LLM, and the process was represented by the responses flowing between the agents.\n",
    "- The local-perspective systems, also defined in a loop, were very similar but had better support for modeling multiple destinct personas. They mapped from some global state system into something the LLM was suited to handle, and mapped back up to the global state in the same manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were technically relying on the LangChain software stack to connect to our model below a plethora of abstractions, but we really were just using some simple primitives to make our agent systems work. The real interesting parts involved the organization of these primitives to create synergized components that made it easy for our agents - or even humans - to communicate appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will briefly introduce CrewAI as a potential framework of interest.** Though the course will not use CrewAI much - and we will explain why shortly - it is important to understand:\n",

    "\n",
    "As advertised, **CrewAI** is a well-built and general-purpose multi-agent framework, which roughly means it has:\n",
    "- A mechanism for communication that it enforces.\n",
    "- Some core workflows that it advertises to streamline.\n",
    "- Some primitives defined to make those workflows easy to execute on.\n",
    "- Paths towards productionalization for multi-tenant and concurrent execution. (*more on that later*)\n",

    "\n",
    "To be clear, their abstractions are more than enough to execute on the processes covered in the scope of this course, and we encourage you to try it out for yourself with more involved use-cases after the class!"

This requires a different set of arguments, encapsulates `Agent` entities to communicate which ones can work on the process, and computes an appropriate prompt component via the `.prompt()` method.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> And to top it off, the [**`Crew`**](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/crews) abstraction contains both `Task`s and `Agent`s, and allows them to communicate (via a `Process` class) in a sequential or hierarchical manner to achieve the list of `Tasks`.\n",

    "- For agent applications that leverage persona-based systems, **CrewAI is likely the easiest entrypoint when you want to deploy groups of easy-to-specify agents.** You can already see that there is a lot of baked-in assumptions, and checking the parameter list will reveal various customization options which help to alleviate the pain of system specification and a decent bit of boilerplate.\n",
    "- For more custom applications that require more involved state management systems, **LangGraph is another great option which we will take advantage of later.** This framework makes it easy to go deep into customization land while still sticking to the core abstraction, but it also generally requires a better understanding of agent system design and therefore has a higher learning curve. \n",

All of these paradigms COULD be made with the primitive components offered by LangChain OR LangGraph, but there's significant value in an opinionated framework that makes the hard decisions for you and just lets you tap into the abstraction without too much trouble. For this reason, we will try to point out to **CrewAI** example solutions when we see it helping with the course narrative."
